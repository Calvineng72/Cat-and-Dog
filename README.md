# Cat and Dog

Cat and Dog is a classifier that identifies whether an image is a cat or dog using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project was intended as a basic introduction to Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques. The model developed in the project has 84% accuracy, and the model is used on a photo of my cat Mr. Peaches at the end of the Jupyter notebook. The dataset used for the project can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

The project is largely based upon code and lessons using the same or similar datasets:
